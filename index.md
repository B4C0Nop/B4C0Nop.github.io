# Welcome to My Blog

Hey! I'm Bacon. This is my new blog.
I’ll be posting updates here as I go.  

- **Day 37**: Starting out — created the blog on GitHub.  
- **Day 36**: Watched the x64dbg dev stream, read *Practical Malware Analysis* (ch.18), and checked out various UPX unpacking tutorials.  
  I was supposed to post my first tutorial today, but the topic turned out to be more complicated than I expected. A bit disappointed to   have missed the goal, but that just means more to learn. Planning to read Flare-On writeups until I fall asleep.  

More posts soon...
