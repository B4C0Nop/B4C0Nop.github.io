# Welcome to My Blog

Hey! I'm Bacon. This is my blog.
I’ll be posting updates here as I go. 

## Most Recent Post
**Day 28:** Bookmarked and read through Siew Yi Liang’s (sonictk) [Windows x64 Assembly notes](https://sonictk.github.io/asm_tutorial/), an excellent resource I’d highly recommend. Applied for the [PECompact trial](https://bitsum.com/pecompact_trial.php) (with a beta included), but it’s 32-bit only, so I grabbed [MPRESS](https://web.archive.org/web/20150511220826/http://www.matcode.com/mpress.219.zip) instead. Collected resources and screenshots for the MPRESS tutorial and finished a rough draft ([here](MPRESStut.md)). Someone in the OALabs Discord mentioned a packer called [vxlang](https://github.com/vxlang/vxlang-page), which I might use for a future tutorial. Also listened to [episode 09 of Behind the Binary with Thomas Roccia](https://pocketcasts.com/podcasts/69ee01c0-78f3-013d-fdd6-0affe53ca763/44be198a-ffd0-43a4-8e08-ba75425dc9e2), who talked about the [uprotect project](https://github.com/fr0gger/unprotect
), giving me more reason to dig deeper into [YARA](https://virustotal.github.io/yara/). Progress feels steady, but I need more hands-on work. Tomorrow I’ll look for labs or crackmes that hit multiple study goals at once. *Carpe Diem*
## Previous Posts 

- **Day 37:** Created the blog on GitHub.  
- **Day 36:** Watched the [x64dbg dev stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eODAI3Z1dKc) , read *Practical Malware Analysis* (ch.18), and checked out various UPX unpacking tutorials. I was supposed to post my first tutorial today, but the topic turned out to be more complicated than I expected. A bit disappointed to have missed the goal, but that just means more to learn. Planning to read Flare-On writeups until I fall asleep.  
- **Day 35:** Finished the rough draft of the tutorial ([here](UpxTut.md)). Still need to figure out how to move it to a separate page without breaking the formatting. The tutorial itself needs a lot of formatting improvements, but I’m relieved it’s finished as it’s the end of Day 35, and I’ve already spent more time on this than I originally planned. I’ll keep reading Flare-On write-ups until I fall asleep. Tomorrow I’ll make a study plan
- **Day 34:** Worked a bit on the formatting today: bolded some sections and fixed the links. I’ll probably keep tweaking things little by little, experimenting with different ideas. Also played around with screenshots and figured out a few tricks that should save me time and make my workflow smoother. I’ve been browsing through a lot of other blogs, including some from friends, to see what I can adapt for mine. Really like the aesthetic of [HeapOverflow’s](https://revdiaries.com/), the professionalism of [Hasherezade’s](https://hshrzd.wordpress.com/), and the style of [Rick’s](https://0xrick.github.io/) -- hoping to pull a little inspiration from each. Didn’t get quite as much done as I’d hoped, but I kept up with reading Flare-On write-ups and added more notes for my study guide. Planning to wrap that up tomorrow.
- **Day 33:** Listened to a new podcast and in episode 4 they mentioned SolarWinds, which sent me down a rabbit hole learning more about it--here are some links: [1](https://pocketcasts.com/podcasts/69ee01c0-78f3-013d-fdd6-0affe53ca763/efe1653c-e1f0-4414-9263-b347532f1da6) [2](https://www.solarwinds.com/blog/solarwinds-update-on-security-vulnerability
) [3](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa20-352a
). We had an internet outage for most of the day, but luckily I had write-ups downloaded to read and made sure to grab more just in case. Happy Ukraine Independence Day! Today, August 24, Ukraine celebrates its independence, marked by the Declaration of Independence in 1991. Instead of a strict study schedule, I’m experimenting with a list of things to do and working through them while setting weekly goals. Hopefully I’ll get more done tomorrow.
- **Day 32:** Wasted most of the day trying to get the [ManyTypes](https://github.com/snowsnowsnows/ManyTypes) [plugin](https://github.com/snowsnowsnows/ManyTypes/releases/tag/v2.1) for x64dbg installed and working. Haven’t succeeded yet, but poking around x64dbg and its plugins still feels like a good time investment. Read write-ups and added items to my study list. I thought I’d be further along, but after going through a 50+ page write-up last night, I realized I’ve severely underestimated this task. Feels like I might have bitten off way more than I can chew, but the only option now is to keep moving forward and hopefully start clearing items from my list instead of just adding more sooner rather than later.
- **Day 31:** Listened to [episode 6](https://pocketcasts.com/podcasts/69ee01c0-78f3-013d-fdd6-0affe53ca763/9ce71f67-a554-44a9-8ef4-ef26a8350fb1 ) of the podcast, which just so happened to feature Duncan and mentioned [Lena151](https://github.com/kosmokato/Lena151/tree/main/%5BSnD%5D%20%5Blena151%5D%20Reversing%20With%20Lena%20(Tutorials)). I plan to check out the tutorials later as they look like a solid resource. After that, I watched the [InvokeRE stream](https://www.twitch.tv/InvokeReversing). I added the [UPX tutorial](UpxTut.md) to a separate page. I also got the [ManyTypes](https://github.com/snowsnowsnows/ManyTypes) plugin for x64dbg working! I’m going to test it out further and report any odd behavior to the developers. Overall, I feel like I got quite a bit accomplished today, so I’m happy with the progress. This post marks the end of Day 31, which leaves only 30 more days until the [Flare-On](https://flare-on.com/) competition. I at least completed the bare minimum preparation for the week, so I’ll call it a win. I just need to focus on clearing items from my todo/study list rather than adding more but we’re not quite there yet. *Ç'est la vie*
- **Day 30:** Joined the [Cyber Yeti Discord](https://discord.gg/t9eUtXEP) and saw a lot of familiar people. [Everyone’s](https://nitter.tiekoetter.com/vxunderground/status/1960649135972847807#m) talking about the [DEF CON](https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2033/DEF%20CON%2033%20presentations/Agostino%20Panico%20-%20De-Virtualizing%20the%20Dragon%20Automated%20Unpacking%20and%20Deobfuscation%20of%20Nested%20VM-Based%20Protectors%20using%20Symbolic%20Execution%20and%20Taint%20Tracking.pdf) AI [slop](https://github.com/poppopjmp/VMDragonSlayer/tree/main) talk. Watched a Duncan tutorial on [Windows internals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nJltUokE0&t=2996s) and grabbed two new tools [Procmon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) and [CFF Explorer](https://ntcore.com/explorer-suite/). Spent some time with family and solved some Morse code with my grandpa which was a lot of fun -- hoping we make that a recurring event. Only 30 days left until Flare-On, so I need to start kicking things into high gear, but I’m glad I took the time to slow down today. Overall, I’d say it was time well spent.
- **Day 29:** Read Chapter 16 of [PMA](https://github.com/mikesiko/PracticalMalwareAnalysis-Labs) and listened to episode 07 of [Behind the Binary with Jordan Wiens](https://pocketcasts.com/podcasts/69ee01c0-78f3-013d-fdd6-0affe53ca763/5b2402fd-094e-413d-8d6a-789abfc7e3fd) (bninja). Speaking of bninja, Xusheng announced that Vector35 will be hosting a [conference](https://re-verse.io/) in Florida next March. I can’t afford a ticket, but it would be nice to figure out some way to attend and finally meet some friends in person. Joined the [CrackMyApp](https://discord.gg/cx3sMjKhch) Discord. Later I listened to episode 08 of [Behind the Binary with Roman Hussy](https://pocketcasts.com/podcasts/69ee01c0-78f3-013d-fdd6-0affe53ca763/7d0fb67f-dd9a-40c6-9bc0-ff579fe81e8c), the founder of [abuse.ch](https://abuse.ch/). Currently working on a new tutorial on manually unpacking PECompact. I'm still gathering sources, but hopefully I’ll have it done tomorrow.
- **Day 28:** Bookmarked and read through Siew Yi Liang’s (sonictk) [Windows x64 Assembly notes](https://sonictk.github.io/asm_tutorial/), an excellent resource I’d highly recommend. Applied for the [PECompact trial](https://bitsum.com/pecompact_trial.php) (with a beta included), but it’s 32-bit only, so I grabbed [MPRESS](https://web.archive.org/web/20150511220826/http://www.matcode.com/mpress.219.zip) instead.

- **Day 27:** Re-read chapters 1 and 2 of PMA and completed the [labs](https://github.com/mikesiko/PracticalMalwareAnalysis-Labs). Installed [Sandboxie-Plus](https://sandboxie-plus.com/downloads/) and solved [challenge](https://flare-on.com/files/Flare-On6_Challenges.zip) 1 of [Flare-On](https://flare-on.com/) 6 ([Memecat Battlestation)](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/2019-flare-on-challenge-solutions), taking notes and screenshots along the way. Tried out two crackmes, one by [ByteClassic](https://crackmes.one/crackme/68503ad02b84be7ea7743936
) and another by [j2cks1337](https://crackmes.one/crackme/6834cbfb6297cca3ff7d7cd5) -- the first two were easy, but the last one was more of a challenge. Finished rough drafts (here [1](/practice/memecat
/memecat.md) 2 3). Tomorrow I plan to tackle a Flare-On challenge that involves an APK so I can get familiar with the Android reversing tools. Lot more hands-on work than usual today. I think that's exactly what I was missing. Hopefully I can keep up the same pace.
More posts soon...
