# Welcome to My Blog

Hey! I'm Bacon. This is my blog.
I’ll be posting updates here as I go. 

## Most Recent Post
**Day 13:** Listened to BTB E12 [Unpacking Malware & Minds with Danny Quist](https://pocketcasts.com/podcasts/69ee01c0-78f3-013d-fdd6-0affe53ca763), and Splish from OAlabs mentioned using [Volume Shadow Copy Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/file-server/volume-shadow-copy-service) to snapshot bare-metal setups for GPU malware, which I want to look into. Came across [Justice for Hedgehogs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ies9trYRBAk), a philosophy talk; the title caught my attention, and I learned it’s based on a book referencing Archilochus: “a fox knows many things, but a hedgehog knows one big thing.” Also read an [article on LLVM devirtualization of VMProtect and Themida](https://hackyboiz.github.io/2025/09/11/banda/LLVM_based_VMP/en/). Bookmarked an [advanced binary analysis lab in Ghidra](https://gosecure.github.io/presentations/2020-05-15-advanced-binary-analysis/#0
) for later. Spent much of the day helping a new Discord member with a language barrier and saved some Spanish resources for future use. Heapsoverflow noted [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) has a VIM mode, which makes me think about moving off WordPad.Didn’t do much practical work today, but tomorrow is a break day so I’ll have to make up for it later. Dans le meilleur des mondes possibles.

## Previous Posts 

- **Day 37:** Created the blog on GitHub.  
- **Day 36:** Watched the [x64dbg dev stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eODAI3Z1dKc) , read *Practical Malware Analysis* (ch.18), and checked out various UPX unpacking tutorials. I was supposed to post my first tutorial today, but the topic turned out to be more complicated than I expected. A bit disappointed to have missed the goal, but that just means more to learn. Planning to read Flare-On writeups until I fall asleep.  
- **Day 35:** Finished the rough draft of the tutorial ([here](UpxTut.md)). Still need to figure out how to move it to a separate page without breaking the formatting. The tutorial itself needs a lot of formatting improvements, but I’m relieved it’s finished as it’s the end of Day 35, and I’ve already spent more time on this than I originally planned. I’ll keep reading Flare-On write-ups until I fall asleep. Tomorrow I’ll make a study plan
- **Day 34:** Worked a bit on the formatting today: bolded some sections and fixed the links. I’ll probably keep tweaking things little by little, experimenting with different ideas. Also played around with screenshots and figured out a few tricks that should save me time and make my workflow smoother. I’ve been browsing through a lot of other blogs, including some from friends, to see what I can adapt for mine. Really like the aesthetic of [HeapOverflow’s](https://revdiaries.com/), the professionalism of [Hasherezade’s](https://hshrzd.wordpress.com/), and the style of [Rick’s](https://0xrick.github.io/) -- hoping to pull a little inspiration from each. Didn’t get quite as much done as I’d hoped, but I kept up with reading Flare-On write-ups and added more notes for my study guide. Planning to wrap that up tomorrow.
- **Day 33:** Listened to a new podcast and in episode 4 they mentioned SolarWinds, which sent me down a rabbit hole learning more about it--here are some links: [1](https://pocketcasts.com/podcasts/69ee01c0-78f3-013d-fdd6-0affe53ca763/efe1653c-e1f0-4414-9263-b347532f1da6) [2](https://www.solarwinds.com/blog/solarwinds-update-on-security-vulnerability
) [3](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa20-352a
). We had an internet outage for most of the day, but luckily I had write-ups downloaded to read and made sure to grab more just in case. Happy Ukraine Independence Day! Today, August 24, Ukraine celebrates its independence, marked by the Declaration of Independence in 1991. Instead of a strict study schedule, I’m experimenting with a list of things to do and working through them while setting weekly goals. Hopefully I’ll get more done tomorrow.
- **Day 32:** Wasted most of the day trying to get the [ManyTypes](https://github.com/snowsnowsnows/ManyTypes) [plugin](https://github.com/snowsnowsnows/ManyTypes/releases/tag/v2.1) for x64dbg installed and working. Haven’t succeeded yet, but poking around x64dbg and its plugins still feels like a good time investment. Read write-ups and added items to my study list. I thought I’d be further along, but after going through a 50+ page write-up last night, I realized I’ve severely underestimated this task. Feels like I might have bitten off way more than I can chew, but the only option now is to keep moving forward and hopefully start clearing items from my list instead of just adding more sooner rather than later.
- **Day 31:** Listened to [episode 6](https://pocketcasts.com/podcasts/69ee01c0-78f3-013d-fdd6-0affe53ca763/9ce71f67-a554-44a9-8ef4-ef26a8350fb1 ) of the podcast, which just so happened to feature Duncan and mentioned [Lena151](https://github.com/kosmokato/Lena151/tree/main/%5BSnD%5D%20%5Blena151%5D%20Reversing%20With%20Lena%20(Tutorials)). I plan to check out the tutorials later as they look like a solid resource. After that, I [watched](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GaJ_VVv2gk) the [InvokeRE stream](https://www.twitch.tv/InvokeReversing). I added the [UPX tutorial](UpxTut.md) to a separate page. I also got the [ManyTypes](https://github.com/snowsnowsnows/ManyTypes) plugin for x64dbg working! I’m going to test it out further and report any odd behavior to the developers. Overall, I feel like I got quite a bit accomplished today, so I’m happy with the progress. This post marks the end of Day 31, which leaves only 30 more days until the [Flare-On](https://flare-on.com/) competition. I at least completed the bare minimum preparation for the week, so I’ll call it a win. I just need to focus on clearing items from my todo/study list rather than adding more but we’re not quite there yet. *Ç'est la vie*
- **Day 30:** Joined the [Cyber Yeti Discord](https://discord.gg/t9eUtXEP) and saw a lot of familiar people. [Everyone’s](https://nitter.tiekoetter.com/vxunderground/status/1960649135972847807#m) talking about the [DEF CON](https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2033/DEF%20CON%2033%20presentations/Agostino%20Panico%20-%20De-Virtualizing%20the%20Dragon%20Automated%20Unpacking%20and%20Deobfuscation%20of%20Nested%20VM-Based%20Protectors%20using%20Symbolic%20Execution%20and%20Taint%20Tracking.pdf) AI [slop](https://github.com/poppopjmp/VMDragonSlayer/tree/main) talk. Watched a Duncan tutorial on [Windows internals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nJltUokE0&t=2996s) and grabbed two new tools [Procmon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) and [CFF Explorer](https://ntcore.com/explorer-suite/). Spent some time with family and solved some Morse code with my grandpa which was a lot of fun -- hoping we make that a recurring event. Only 30 days left until Flare-On, so I need to start kicking things into high gear, but I’m glad I took the time to slow down today. Overall, I’d say it was time well spent.
- **Day 29:** Read Chapter 16 of [PMA](https://github.com/mikesiko/PracticalMalwareAnalysis-Labs) and listened to episode 07 of [Behind the Binary with Jordan Wiens](https://pocketcasts.com/podcasts/69ee01c0-78f3-013d-fdd6-0affe53ca763/5b2402fd-094e-413d-8d6a-789abfc7e3fd) (bninja). Speaking of bninja, Xusheng announced that Vector35 will be hosting a [conference](https://re-verse.io/) in Florida next March. I can’t afford a ticket, but it would be nice to figure out some way to attend and finally meet some friends in person. Joined the [CrackMyApp](https://discord.gg/cx3sMjKhch) Discord. Later I listened to episode 08 of [Behind the Binary with Roman Hussy](https://pocketcasts.com/podcasts/69ee01c0-78f3-013d-fdd6-0affe53ca763/7d0fb67f-dd9a-40c6-9bc0-ff579fe81e8c), the founder of [abuse.ch](https://abuse.ch/). Currently working on a new tutorial on manually unpacking PECompact. I'm still gathering sources, but hopefully I’ll have it done tomorrow.
- **Day 28:** Bookmarked and read through Siew Yi Liang’s (sonictk) [Windows x64 Assembly notes](https://sonictk.github.io/asm_tutorial/), an excellent resource I’d highly recommend. Applied for the [PECompact trial](https://bitsum.com/pecompact_trial.php) (with a beta included), but it’s 32-bit only, so I grabbed [MPRESS](https://web.archive.org/web/20150511220826/http://www.matcode.com/mpress.219.zip) instead. Collected resources and screenshots for the MPRESS tutorial and finished a rough draft ([here](MPRESStut.md)). Someone in the OALabs Discord mentioned a packer called [vxlang](https://github.com/vxlang/vxlang-page), which I might use for a future tutorial. Also listened to [episode 09 of Behind the Binary with Thomas Roccia](https://pocketcasts.com/podcasts/69ee01c0-78f3-013d-fdd6-0affe53ca763/44be198a-ffd0-43a4-8e08-ba75425dc9e2), who talked about the [uprotect project](https://github.com/fr0gger/unprotect
), giving me more reason to dig deeper into [YARA](https://virustotal.github.io/yara/). Progress feels steady, but I need more hands-on work. Tomorrow I’ll look for labs or crackmes that hit multiple study goals at once. *Carpe Diem*
- **Day 27:** Re-read chapters 1 and 2 of PMA and completed the [labs](https://github.com/mikesiko/PracticalMalwareAnalysis-Labs). Installed [Sandboxie-Plus](https://sandboxie-plus.com/downloads/) and solved [challenge](https://flare-on.com/files/Flare-On6_Challenges.zip) 1 of [Flare-On](https://flare-on.com/) 6 ([Memecat Battlestation)](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/2019-flare-on-challenge-solutions), taking notes and screenshots along the way. Tried out two crackmes, one by [ByteClassic](https://crackmes.one/crackme/68503ad02b84be7ea7743936
) and another by [j2cks1337](https://crackmes.one/crackme/6834cbfb6297cca3ff7d7cd5) -- the first two were easy, but the last one was more of a challenge. Finished rough drafts here [1](practice/memecat/memecat.md) [2](practice/crackme1/crackme1.md) [3](practice/crackme2/nuclearhd.md). Tomorrow I plan to do a Flare-On challenge that involves an APK so I can get familiar with the Android reversing tools. Lot more hands-on work than usual today. I think that's exactly what I was missing. Hopefully I can keep up the same pace.
- **Day 26:** Helped a friend with some binary analysis today, which ended up taking most of my time. I downloaded a few Android reverse engineering tools: [Apktool](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/), [dex2jar](https://github.com/pxb1988/dex2jar), and [JD-GUI](http://java-decompiler.github.io/) and read through some related Flare-on write-ups. Didn’t get around to finishing the challenge like I planned, though. Took a break today and read Emerson’s essay [Self-Reliance](https://archive.vcu.edu/english/engweb/transcendentalism/authors/emerson/essays/selfreliance.html). One line that stood out: *“The voyage of the best ship is a zigzag line of a hundred tacks.”* Felt like a nice fit for this journey. What a great author. I highly recommend the essay. Learned today from Xusheng that I should be using [dnSpyEx](https://github.com/dnSpyEx/dnSpy) instead of [dnSpy](https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy) since dnSpyEx is actively maintained, while dnSpy has been archived and contains a known [vulnerability](https://blog.washi.dev/posts/popping-calcs-in-dnspy/) that involves a DLL hijack that leads to arbitrary code execution. He just finished reversing some malware that contained [IDATLoader](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2023/08/31/fake-update-utilizes-new-idat-loader-to-execute-stealc-and-lumma-infostealers/), and I’m looking forward to his blog post about it. My goal for tomorrow is to finish one or two APK-related challenges.
- **Day 25:** [Watched](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP5AEgaOZNo) [Tony’s](https://nitter.tiekoetter.com/cyb3rjerry) [stream](https://www.twitch.tv/humpty_tony) reverse engineering malware. Inspired to make a DRM tutorial after listening to [Episode 10 of BTB with Tim Blazytko](https://pocketcasts.com/podcasts/69ee01c0-78f3-013d-fdd6-0affe53ca763/df176474-1e33-4e6f-9a05-6480863bfa76). Spent most of Labor Day resting and studying [Hamlet (1996)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vIrIreGHVI); pausing to look up words and replay scenes made it take far longer than the four-hour runtime. Spent the last hour on [FLARE 6](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/2019-flare-on-challenge-solutions) Challenge 4 (Flarebear) but didn’t get far enough to finish a writeup. Tomorrow I’ll revisit it, study relevant sources for deeper understanding, and tackle another APK-related challenge. All in all, a much-needed rest day.
- **Day 24:** Bought two new books: [Malware Analyst’s Cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/Malware-Analysts-Cookbook-DVD-Techniques/dp/0470613033/) and [Hacker Disassembling Uncovered](https://www.amazon.com/Hacker-Disassembling-Uncovered-Kris-Kaspersky/dp/1931769648/) after seeing them recommended on [Hasherezade’s blog](https://hshrzd.wordpress.com/how-to-start/). Spent most of the day reading and plan to keep at it tonight. Had a good conversation with Ruby and [Heapoverflow](https://revdiaries.com/) on Discord about the [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) and [imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome), which was nice. Still running into trouble with the tools for the APK challenges, so I’ve decided to set up a separate computer with [FLARE-VM](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/flare-vm-the-windows-malware/). That way I’ll have everything preinstalled and won’t waste time configuring tools on my laptop. My goal for tomorrow is to get that environment ready and start switching between the two machines during the challenges.
- **Day 23:** Got invited to a new Discord, [MalwareAnalysisForHedgehogs](https://discord.gg/3evhC4cj), by my friend [Struppigel](https://xcancel.com/struppigel), who also just released a new malware analysis [course](https://malwareanalysis-for-hedgehogs.learnworlds.com/course/intermediate-level). Asked which VM I should use, and got mixed advice: Ruby and Xusheng recommended [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/), while Boozy said [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) works better for him on Ubuntu. I tried VMware first, but four hours later discovered my CPU only supports first-gen AMD-V and lacks Rapid Virtualization Indexing (RVI) which VMware dropped support for years ago. Luckily, VirtualBox still supports older chips with a software MMU fallback. Long story short: VMware refused to run, but I got VirtualBox working and installed [FLARE-VM](https://github.com/mandiant/flare-vm). Didn’t expect this to turn into an all-day affair. Tomorrow my goal is to tackle at least one APK-related challenge.
- **Day 22:** Read articles on ["hyperjacking"](https://www.wired.com/story/hyperjacking-vmware-mandiant/) with [Voyager](<https://blog.back.engineering/20/04/2021/>) and [Diskjacker](<https://readcc.net/posts/runtimehypervhijacking/>), which were really informative. Xusheng shared a tweet from [NickHarbour](https://xcancel.com/nickharbour/status/1963597084562788381#m) that Flare-On will be shortened from six weeks to four, and someone posted a [bingo card generator](https://washi.dev/bingo.html) for Flare-On. Hilarious, but could be useful to get a sense of what to expect. Still having trouble with my VM: 2 GB of RAM wasn’t nearly enough for the tools I installed, and I missed installing a few others, so I decided to start fresh and create a new VM overnight. I’ll focus on APK challenges once it’s set up. For now, I’m concentrating on learning how to reverse engineer VM-protected binaries like [WeeperVM](https://github.com/A-Benlolo/WeeperVM) and [VMProtect](https://vmpsoft.com/), which will be my focus tomorrow.
- **Day 21:** Revisited OALabs’ VM setup advice, but their newest [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adAr0KBJm4U) just repeated my current setup. Reassuring but not very helpful for Flare-On. Watched a few more of their [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT2U3UXhic4), including one on [emulation vs. virtualization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPrqOIdNlrQ&t=4s). Got invited to a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/beaujeant/PwnAdventure3) for modding [PwnAdventure3](https://www.pwnadventure.com/ ), the game originally created by [Vector35](https://vector35.com/) for the [Ghost in the Shellcode 2015 CTF](https://ctftime.org/ctf/26/), which looks like a fun side project. [Deluks](https://xcancel.com/0xDeLuks), who has his own [blog](https://deluks2006.github.io/), recommended I read [Unpacking With Anthracene](https://forum.tuts4you.com/files/file/2040-unpacking-with-anthracene/?&do=getNewComment) on Tuts4you, so I bookmarked that for later. Also made an account on [crackmy.app](https://crackmy.app/), got verified on their [Discord](https://discord.gg/re9EeQ6G), and even connected with one of the admins who recently released a new [Steam game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3909120/Picaro/). After researching virtualizers, [Tigress](https://tigress.wtf/index.html) seems like a solid place to start. Tomorrow I’ll either dive into that or practice scripting and YARA.
- **Day 20:**  Watched more [LiveOverflow videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzM4o6qxssk&pp=0gcJCcYJAYcqIYzv) on [PwnAdventure3](https://github.com/beaujeant/PwnAdventure3); the project seems awesome but I’m not sure I’ll have time to dive in right now. Listened to [Behind the Binary Ep. 11 with Greg Sinclair](https://pocketcasts.com/podcast/behind-the-binary-by-google-cloud-security/69ee01c0-78f3-013d-fdd6-0affe53ca763/ep11-tracing-lazarus-greg-sinclair-on-attributing-north-korean-cyber-threats-through-binary-similarity/3a51eb14-f6e4-49b3-831f-dff80baf05b9), which covered the [Lazarus Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazarus_Group) which was super interesting. Saw that Xusheng announced an upcoming [Crackmes.one RE CTF](https://crackmesone.ctfd.io/ ), which looks exciting and will happen in January. Saw this [ASCII art](https://x86re.com/2.html ) I thought was cool enough to share. Also got invited on Discord to solve a [crackme](https://crackmes.one/crackme/68ba2eea8fac2855fe6fbb09) for a 100% discount on [Hacker’s Edge](https://hackersedgebook.com/ ) by the author himself, [Ryan Merket](https://xcancel.com/ryanmerket). Took me most of the night... lots of debugging and patching before realizing the solution was simple but I came away with good Python scripting practice. Stackpointer solved it right after me and ran into the same hurdles. The book drops on the 16th, which also happens to be his birthday. Ryan already released [V2 of his crackme](https://crackmes.one/crackme/68bcfb41224c0ec5dcedbde2), so I’ll try that soon. My next goals is to work on YARA, Tigress, APKs, or maybe more Python scripting though tomorrow is Sunday, so I might start using it as a rest day. *vidi vici veni*
- **Day 19:** Spent the day reading [Kierkegaard’s Fear and Trembling](https://www.sorenkierkegaard.nl/artikelen/Engels/101.%20Fear%20and%20Trembling%20book%20Kierkegaard.pdf) alongside some [biblical study](https://app.logos.com/books/LLS%3A1.0.710?textPosition=res%2FLLS%3A1.0.710%2F2019-04-30T20%3A46%3A24Z%2F1028780&tile=right&zzls=2eMKcTcKMwr0Ow4IgFEbDn8OlJsOdwppSasOiD1t1w5NuJi7DhsKBw5bDm8KIwqXCgEBJDMOhw53DhcKtw6vDucOOw7kiBMK0TmgFwozClmDCuELDmRpzw5LDs8OMw5XDkwHCu8OHDMO9S8OxGcKBAcOpwrXCnhzDqcK6a8KxaS%2FDpxs9w5Q1wrE4wqJFNcKgI8K9w6glFsONcXrCh2rCv8KrKMKUw7BZw5B%2BwoFFw7BCw74vJMKOPmNjwoXCtsOCw6fChTYpwpURw7jDoEXDiMKCwrcLwq7CqsKVwrdNw6nCkX5Rwpw7LQ%3D%3D). Downloaded and installed [PwnAdventure3](https://www.pwnadventure.com/#downloads), though I still need to finish setting up WSL and Docker before I can try it out. Hopefully have most of it done tomorrow morning. Also read through some [Tigress docs](https://tigress.wtf/tigress-quickstart.html). Not much reverse engineering progress today, but I think taking one day off a week will help me avoid burnout. Next steps are more [Tigress reading](https://www.mitchellzakocs.com/blog/tigress#:~:text=the%20instruction%20pointer%20was%20only,an%20operand%2C%20but%20I%27ll%20talk), plus work on YARA, APKs, and maybe more Python scripting. 
*In manus tuas, Domine, commendo spiritum meum.*
- **Day 18:** Started reading The Brothers Karamazov by Dostoevsky. Watched [MAH’s new video on setting breakpoints for unpacking malware](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn8rAm9u4rc), plus a documentary on the [Battle of the Bulge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJmhD2Llejo&t=101s). Cyber Yeti announced there will be a [stream with Xusheng](https://youtu.be/-eVyYB83hH0) on Wednesday, which I’m very much looking forward to. Also spent time learning more about YARA. Read through the [official docs](https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and a [beginner’s tutorial](https://kennethghartman.com/blog/getting-started-with-yara/#:~:text=YARA%20is%20an%20open,match%20against%20files%2C%20memory%2C%20or) that was super helpful. Tomorrow I need to get more hands-on, probably by writing some YARA rules for a binary (maybe that [crackme I solved](https://crackmes.one/crackme/68ba2eea8fac2855fe6fbb09) earlier for the free book). Still need to finish setting up the PwnAdventure3 project as well. Future goals remain the same as yesterday.

- **Day 17:** Shared a [Git branching tutorial](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=en_US) with lexzor, who’s been making progress on the [PwnAdventure3 project](https://github.com/lexzor/pwa3-mod/tree/main). He’s building an event system through a centralized EventsManager with callbacks for things like player joins and chat commands, plus a [logger class](https://github.com/lexzor/pwa3-mod/blob/main/src/utils/logger.h) for debugging. I mentioned how it could resemble a plugin framework. Xylo is busy with [Plasma](https://github.com/B4C0Nop/Plasma) and writing a basic encoder; I hope to contribute more to both projects when I can. [Scooby Doo & The Cyber Chase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fohPSsY_dz0&list=PLu7gJyfVz-SA7zbfEBUrl49FpYIC4sjLD&pp=0gcJCXwEOCosWNin) was recommended by [smelly](https://nitter.tiekoetter.com/vxunderground?cursor=DAAHCgABG0VlZUe__9YLAAIAAAATMTk2MzY2MTkwNTcwNjIzNDAyMggAAwAAAAIAAA), so I gave it a watch. Someone recommended the [Zero2Auto course](https://www.0ffset.net/training/zero2auto/), and everyone has been discussing the recent [NPM package compromise](https://www.aikido.dev/blog/npm-debug-and-chalk-packages-compromised
) -- which the [attacker botched](https://www.securityalliance.org/news/2025-09-npm-supply-chain), limiting the damage. Watched [Josh’s stream](https://www.twitch.tv/InvokeReversing) on triaging obfuscated binaries related to the same incident, and read an interesting [blog on Windows Defender](https://retooling.io/blog/an-unexpected-journey-into-microsoft-defenders-signature-world). Heapsoverflow mentioned [Phrack](https://phrack.org/issues/72/19#article) is releasing new issues. On the practical side, I wrote my first YARA rule on a custom binary, starting with a simple string match (“Hello World”). Good first step into YARA; tomorrow I’ll try more complex rules. *Il faut cultiver le jardin*

- **Day 16:** Watched [LaurieWired’s new video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by53T03Eeds) on the [IOCCC obfuscated C code contest](https://www.ioccc.org/), which was a good overview of various obfuscation techniques, including one that used a custom VM. Heapsoverflow also shared a report on [automatic deobfuscation of virtualized binaries with LLVM](https://blog.thalium.re/posts/misc/llvm-powered-devirtualization/internship-report.pdf), which paired well with the theme. I read an article on the [Scatterbrain compiler obfuscator](https://retooling.io/blog/my-emulation-goes-to-the-moon-until-false-flag), a nice dive into emulation quirks. Found a public domain copy of [Plutarch’s Lives](https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/public/gdcmassbookdig/plutarchslivesco00plut/plutarchslivesco00plut.pdf
), a favorite of Emerson and Shakespeare, and bookmarked it to read later. I was going to watch the [1945 Henry V](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36adDm7Abw&pp=ygUHaGVucnkgdg%3D%3D) but ended up with the 1989 version instead. Came across a [blog on Android app analysis](https://www.mobile-hacker.com/) that seems useful down the line, and Huntress’s [write-up on the NPM attacker’s operation](https://www.huntress.com/blog/rare-look-inside-attacker-operation). Still need to check out BitShifted’s new [crackme](
https://crackmes.one/crackme/68bffbe9224c0ec5dcedbe7a) and give feedback. [Josh’s stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVyYB83hH0) with Xusheng starts soon, which should be today’s highlight. I didn’t get much hands-on work done, so that’s the main goal for tomorrow.

- **Day 15:** Enjoyed the stream with Josh and Xusheng last night, where Josh shared a link on [Time Travel Debugging, TTD](https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2019/05/time-travel-debugging-its-a-blast-from-the-past/). Learned a lot about TTD and had a great conversation with Xusheng on Discord afterwards, and I hope to meet him in person at a conference in Orlando. Our internet was out most of the day due to switching providers, so I focused on reading [Plutarch’s Lives](https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/public/gdcmassbookdig/plutarchslivesco00plut/plutarchslivesco00plut.pdf), which has been fascinating. Someone on Discord shared an [online assembler](https://ret.futo.org/), which I plan to bookmark for later. I also read a blog post on [building a basic x64 Linux rootkit](https://itnext.io/building-a-basic-x64-linux-rootkit-4f8d931b688f), which was really neat. Also spent some time watching an OALabs video on [Reverse Engineering DLLs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbIjHJ1ygBY&t=21s), which gave me some useful insights into analyzing dynamic libraries and a few videos from [Lena151’s playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35P6SJTfVgo&list=PLcFUp5WYCxVYeR7AgsmjzGW6PjamaY6JO&index=3). Worked on BitShifted’s [crackme](https://crackmes.one/crackme/68bffbe9224c0ec5dcedbe7a), making static analysis progress and practicing [writing YARA rules](Bitshifted/runtime.md) for the binary. Didn’t finish the challenge, but it was a productive mix of reading and hands-on practice. Goals for tomorrow are more YARA rules or Python scripting practice, maybe even trying some more Flare-On challenges.

- **Day 14:** Thinking about getting a copy of [Malware Analysis on Steroids](https://www.amazon.com/MAoS-Analysis-Steroids-Real-World-Engineering/dp/B0FQDGZGZW) after Rajnikanth shared a photo of the TOC and compared it to the [MAS series by Alexandre Borges](https://exploitreversing.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/mas_1_rev_1.pdf). Someone shared a sweet [dark-mode hex editor](https://github.com/WerWolv/ImHex) that I want to try out later. Xusheng showed me an awesome [blog post](https://binary.ninja/2024/12/16/flareon-ttd.html) about using [TTD with Binary Ninja](https://docs.binary.ninja/guide/debugger/dbgeng-ttd.html) to analyze the Flare-On [Serpentine](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/flare-on11-challenge9-serpentine.pdf
) challenge, and he was fine with me posting about [Tigress-protected](https://tigress.wtf/) binaries (for educational purposes) rather than commercial protectors like VMProtect or Themida. I also found this [blog](https://blog.thalium.re/posts/llvm-powered-devirtualization/) that had a report on [LLVM-powered devirtualization that uses Mermaid to deobfuscate Tigress-protected binaries](https://blog.thalium.re/posts/misc/llvm-powered-devirtualization/internship-report.pdf), which seems very relevant to my goals. Struppigel pointed me to the [FLARE-ON PyArmor writeup](https://github.com/levanvn/FLARE-ON9-Chal11_Unpacking-Pyarmor) for unpacking Python protections, and Check Point published an [analysis of the new Yurei ransomware](https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/yurei-the-ghost-of-open-source-ransomware ) that just appeared recently. Lots of research notes today, and I didn’t do heavy hands-on work so tomorrow I’ll try to do something more practical.

- **Day 13:** Listened to BTB E12 [Unpacking Malware & Minds with Danny Quist](https://pocketcasts.com/podcasts/69ee01c0-78f3-013d-fdd6-0affe53ca763), and Splish from OAlabs mentioned using [Volume Shadow Copy Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/file-server/volume-shadow-copy-service) to snapshot bare-metal setups for GPU malware, which I want to look into. Came across [Justice for Hedgehogs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ies9trYRBAk), a philosophy talk; the title caught my attention, and I learned it’s based on a book referencing Archilochus: “a fox knows many things, but a hedgehog knows one big thing.” Also read an [article on LLVM devirtualization of VMProtect and Themida](https://hackyboiz.github.io/2025/09/11/banda/LLVM_based_VMP/en/). Bookmarked an [advanced binary analysis lab in Ghidra](https://gosecure.github.io/presentations/2020-05-15-advanced-binary-analysis/#0
) for later. Spent much of the day helping a new Discord member with a language barrier and saved some Spanish resources for future use. Heapsoverflow noted [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/
) has a VIM mode, which makes me think about moving off WordPad.Didn’t do much practical work today, but tomorrow is a break day so I’ll have to make up for it later. Dans le meilleur des mondes possibles.
